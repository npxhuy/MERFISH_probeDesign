The sequenced strain was obtained from Floyd E. Dewhirst and Jacques Izard (ATCC 51259).\nWe have performed one round of automated sequence improvement (pre-finishing), along with manual improvement that includes breaking apart any mis-assembly, and making manual joins where possible. Manual edits also are made where the consensus appears to be incorrect. All low quality data on the ends of contigs is removed. Contigs are ordered and oriented where possible.\nCoding sequences were predicted using GeneMark v3.3 and Glimmer2 v2.13. Intergenic regions not spanned by GeneMark and Glimmer2 were blasted against NCBI's non-redundant (NR) database and predictions generated based on protein alignments. tRNA genes were determined using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 and non-coding RNA genes by RNAmmer-1.2 and Rfam v8.0. Gene names are generated at the contig level and may not necessarily reflect any known order or orientation between contigs.\nThis work was supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute and the NIH Roadmap Human Microbiome Project [http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp/].\nThis is a reference genome for the Human Microbiome Project.
