This project is co-owned with the Human Microbiome Project DACC. This sequence is generated as a part of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Large-Scale Sequencing Research Network and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Microbial Genome Sequencing Centers Program. The mission of the HMP is to generate resources to enable the characterization of the human microbiota, the microbial communities living within human bodies, and analyze the role of these organisms in human health and disease. See http://www.hmpdacc.org for more information.\nThe sequenced strain was obtained from ATCC. The genomic DNA was prepared from a single bacterial isolate. The sequence generated included at least 10 fold coverage of Roche/454 Lifesciences FLX fragment data and at least 8 fold clone coverage of Roche/454 Lifesciences paired-end data. The Roche/454 Lifesciences sequence was assembled using the Roche/454 Lifescience Newbler assembler. This draft assembly meets the HMP draft quality standards (more than 90% of the genome is included in contigs, more than 90% of a core set of bacterial genes are found with > 30% identity and > 30% length; more than 90% of the bases in the assembly have more than 5 fold sequence coverage, the contig N50 length is greater than 5kb, the scaffold N50 length is greater than 20kb, and there is less than 1 gap per 5kb).\nProduct names were updated in June 2013","pairedAssembly":{"accession":"GCA_000191405.1","annotationName":"Annotation submitted by Baylor College of Medicine","status":"current"},"refseqCategory":"representative genome","releaseDate":"2011-03-04","sequencingTech":"454","submitter":"Baylor College of Medicine"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":4,"contigN50":205363,"gcCount":"826857","gcPercent":39.0,"genomeCoverage":"35.4x","numberOfComponentSequences":30,"numberOfContigs":30,"numberOfScaffolds":10,"scaffoldL50":1,"scaffoldN50":2112961,"totalSequenceLength":"2124757","totalUngappedLength":"2110314"},"averageNucleotideIdentity":{"bestAniMatch":{"ani":99.99,"assembly":"GCA_031191205.1","assemblyCoverage":99.91,"category":"suspected_type","organismName":"Haemophilus parainfluenzae","typeAssemblyCoverage":98.45},"category":"suspected_type","comment":"na","matchStatus":"species_match","submittedAniMatch":{"ani":99.99,"assembly":"GCA_031191205.1","assemblyCoverage":99.91,"category":"suspected_type","organismName":"Haemophilus parainfluenzae ATCC 33392","typeAssemblyCoverage":98.45},"submittedOrganism":"Haemophilus parainfluenzae ATCC 33392","submittedSpecies":"Haemophilus parainfluenzae","taxonomyCheckStatus":"OK"},"checkmInfo":{"checkmMarkerSet":"Haemophilus parainfluenzae","checkmMarkerSetRank":"species","checkmSpeciesTaxId":729,"checkmVersion":"v1.2.2","completeness":99.48,"completenessPercentile":77.9661,"contamination":0.32},"currentAccession":"GCF_000191405.1","organism":{"infraspecificNames":{"strain":"ATCC 33392"},"organismName":"Haemophilus parainfluenzae ATCC 33392","taxId":888828},"pairedAccession":"GCA_000191405.1","sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_REFSEQ","typeMaterial":{"typeDisplayText":"assembly from type material","typeLabel":"TYPE_MATERIAL"},"wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AEWU00000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/AEWU01","wgsProjectAccession":"AEWU01"}}
